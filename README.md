# hello-world
My first repo

Hi all,
Ehsan here. This is kind of my first experience with GitHub. I have worked with GitHub during Cosmo summer school for the first time but back then I did not have enough time to learn the basics. I am commited to learn how to work with GitHub this time and optimistic that will make it my rutine way for coding.
See you soon,
--Ehsan
